# Premium Services Store API

This is a Django Rest Framework (DRF) based e-commerce API for selling premium subscription services for platforms like Telegram, Spotify, YouTube, and more. Users can browse applications (categories), select services, add them to a cart with custom fields (e.g., username, password), proceed to checkout, and complete payments via Zarinpal gateway. It includes features like user authentication, phone verification via SMS (using Kavenegar), discounts, order management, and admin controls. The project is containerized with Docker for easy deployment and uses Celery for asynchronous tasks like SMS sending.

This repository serves as a strong portfolio piece demonstrating full-stack API development, including secure authentication, payment integration, and scalable architecture.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: JWT-based login/register via Djoser, with phone number verification using OTP sent via SMS (Kavenegar integration).
- **Product Catalog**: Applications (categories) and Services with images, descriptions, prices, discounts, and custom required fields (e.g., email, username for premium activations).
- **Shopping Cart**: Add/remove/update items with quantity and extra data (e.g., account credentials). Supports validation for required fields before checkout.
- **Order Management**: Create orders from carts, track status (paid/unpaid/canceled), and view order history. Admins can manage orders.
- **Payment Integration**: Zarinpal gateway for Iranian payments, with sandbox mode support.
- **Discounts**: Apply percentage-based discounts to services.
- **Comments**: Users can leave comments on services, with moderation (approved/waiting/not approved).
- **Admin Panel**: Django admin for managing customers, applications, services, discounts, orders, and more.
- **Filtering & Pagination**: Search, filter (e.g., by price, discount), order, and paginate services/orders.
- **Asynchronous Tasks**: Celery with Redis for background jobs like SMS sending.
- **Security**: Permissions for admin-only actions, validation for required fields, and secure handling of sensitive data (e.g., passwords in extra_data).
- **Media Handling**: Upload and serve images for applications/services.
- **Dockerized**: Ready for production with Docker Compose (Postgres, Redis, Celery worker).

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Django 6.0, Django Rest Framework (DRF)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (with psycopg2-binary)
- **Caching & Queues**: Redis (for Celery broker/result backend)
- **Task Queue**: Celery (for async SMS sending)
- **Authentication**: Djoser + SimpleJWT
- **Payments**: Zarinpal (Iranian gateway)
- **SMS**: Kavenegar API
- **Other Libraries**: django-environ (env management), django-filter, phonenumber-field, Pillow (image processing), debug-toolbar
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose
- **Deployment Tools**: .dockerignore, .gitignore, requirements.txt

### With Docker (Recommended)
1. Clone the repository:
2. Build and start containers:
3. Apply migrations and create superuser:


4. Access the API at `http://localhost:8000/` and admin at `http://localhost:8000/admin/`.

### Locally (Without Docker)
1. Clone the repo and navigate to it.
2. Create a virtual environment:
3. Install dependencies:
4. Set up the database (e.g., PostgreSQL) and Redis.
5. Run migrations and superuser:
6. Start the server:


Start Celery worker separately: `celery -A config worker --loglevel=info`

## Usage
- **Register/Login**: Use `/auth/users/` for registration and `/auth/jwt/create/` for login.
- **Browse Services**: GET `/applications/` or `/applications/<app_pk>/services/`.
- **Cart Operations**: POST to `/carts/` to create a cart, then add items via `/carts/<cart_pk>/items/`.
- **Checkout**: POST to `/orders/` with cart ID, then proceed to payment.
- **Payment**: After order creation, redirect to Zarinpal URL. Callback handles verification.
- **Phone Verification**: Update phone in `/customers/me/`, then verify OTP via `/customers/verify-phone/`.
- **Admin**: Access Django admin for CRUD on models.

For full API documentation, use tools like Swagger (not included, but can be added via drf-yasg).

## API Endpoints
- `/applications/`: List/create applications.
- `/applications/<pk>/services/`: Services under an application.
- `/carts/`: Manage carts.
- `/carts/<pk>/items/`: Cart items.
- `/orders/`: List/create orders.
- `/orders/<pk>/items/`: Order items.
- `/discounts/`: Manage discounts.
- `/customers/me/`: User profile (including phone verification).
- More nested routes for comments, etc. (see `store/urls.py`).
